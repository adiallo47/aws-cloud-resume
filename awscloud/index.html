            <p>About
                First-Generation college graduate that studied computer science at Towson University. 
                I have previous experience in programming creating a series of projects throughout my time in college. My skills include Java, Javascript, C++/C, HTML, and Microsoft proficiency. 
                Iâ€™m constantly leading with curiosity and passion to learn more! and a part time photograhper that has a photography page called  <u><a href="https://www.instagram.com/diallovisuals/" style="display:inline">DialloVisuals.</a></u> 
                I started photography when I was a freshman and fell into the creative world of photography and how to manipulate pictures in my own style. 
                I have a passion with working on cars which I modify and soon would want to expand and take them to the track
